          <h2>Designing a food delivering app</h2>
          <p>CMEOW is a Toronto based Chinese food delievery company, it brings food from restaurants to your footsteps. I've had the pleasure of being CMEOW's first UX designer while it start to expand the team in 2003 to help them designed their first mobile app.</p>

          <h2>My role as the UX designer</h2>
          <p>The very beginning, we were sit in a round table to talk about business needs and design needs. From the word of the founder, I understand we are targeting young chinese female users because that's majority ordering from the website. We also decided that we will focus on the ios platform first because majority ordering from iPhones. I did lots of competitive research and bring up the use of different useful components with the team. From there we started some skectching.</p>

They have as much scientific knowledge as we do (or more), and understand them and model them in a similar way as us (e.g. the atom is comprised of a nucleus and orbiting electrons, light can be modelled as both particles and waves, length contraction is a phenomenon in special relativity, etc.)</li>

          <h2>Mock-up &amp; prototypes</h2>

          <p>I help designed the very first version of their mobile order app. As the only UX designer in the team, I did lots of brainstorming, wireframes.Also did client meetings and collabrate with Qiao, a brilliant visual designer for prototype mock ups & logo designs.
          Considering user expierence, I designed a bottom scroller for users to easily auto jump back and forth to different menu categories. That is base on the research lots of restaurants have long menu, so say switch soup to main dish, people will need scroll further down or close the whole catergories. For easier one hand interaction, I think this design solution will work better.
          Another innovation of the component is the announcement banner, which highlights daily special for restaurants.
          When it comes to the add to cart, the design is will show the minus sign when item >= 1, when item is 0, won't be able to see the minus sign. I am trying to really reduce unnessary compenents on page to avoid confusion.</p>

          <h2>Other Design Decisions</h2>

          <p>My graphic design professor mentioned an interesting point about the arrow in the original plaque: the arrow graphic is an obvious sign of direction to us, but would it be as intuitive to the plaque’s recipients? As a result, I refrained from using any arrows in my redesign. To indicate that the spaceship came from Earth, I used a thin dashed line instead. I was hoping that a dashed line can represent a trail of some sort (maybe the extraterrestrials have seen trails of rocks or crumbs of space-bread) and is therefore a more universal way of representing a path.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>


          <p>Going forward, I think I can refine the number system currently in place. In the original plaque, the hydrogen spin-flip transition graphic is helpful because the pulsar map uses the frequency directly. For me, the wavelength of the transition is just a way for me to represent one unit and establish a “1” in binary. The only other area I use binary is the solar system diagram, and those distances are not connected with the frequency or period of the spin-flip transition. It would be worth experimenting with once again removing the notion of hydrogen altogether and devise a new binary interpretation, possibly starting with some depiction of base 1 and then mapping it to base 2. The top left corner would then be specifically reserved for training the viewer to read new binary system.</p>
