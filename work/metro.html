          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size one vertical or horizontal “seam” of pixels at a time. A vertical seam in an image is a path of pixels connected from the top to the bottom with one pixel in each row; a horizontal seam is a path of pixels connected from the left to the right with one pixel in each column. Unlike standard content-agnostic resizing techniques (such as cropping and scaling), this content-aware technique does not distort the most interest features (aspect ratio, set of objects present, etc.) of the image. Seam carving is now a core feature in Adobe Photoshop and other computer graphics applications.</p>

          <h2>My approch: It is always about story-telling</h2>
          <p>My partner and I created a data type that resizes a w-by-h image using the seam-carving technique for this assignment in our Algorithms and Data Structures class using these few steps:</p>
            
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><img class="row-img" src="img/metro/family.png"></div>
          </div>

          <p><strong>Family</strong> we used the dual-gradient energy function to calculate the energy of a pixel, which is a measure of its importance—the higher the energy, the less likely that the pixel will be included as part of a seam. </p>

          <h2>My approch: It is always about story-telling</h2>
          <div class="row">
          <div class="col"><img class="row-img" src="img/metro/coffee.gif"></div>
          <div class="col"><img class="row-img" src="img/metro/valentine.gif"></div>
          <div class="col"><img class="row-img" src="img/metro/superbowl.gif"></div>
          </div>
          
          <p><strong>Family</strong> we used the dual-gradient energy function to calculate the energy of a pixel, which is a measure of its importance—the higher the energy, the less likely that the pixel will be included as part of a seam. </p>
            
            
          <p>I think those gifs I made did a good job of telling stories, a thrilling throw in superbowl, a family reunion of brunch, a heart been wandering around and finally let someone in and open up, I think that is what make people feel something and influence them, on top of that, they do look pretty.</p>
          <div class="row">
              
            <div class="col"><img class="row-img" src="img/metro/valentines.png"></div>

          </div>

          <h2>End result</h2>
          <p>I think those gifs I made did a good job of telling stories, a thrilling throw in superbowl, a family reunion of brunch, a heart been wandering around and finally let someone in and open up, I think that is what make people feel something and influence them, on top of that, they do look pretty.</p>

          <p>Those gifs did magically well on social, as the resuly we won Metro as a account from traffik agency.</p>

          <p>Let me know what you think, do you think those animations gave them a better purpose?</p>
